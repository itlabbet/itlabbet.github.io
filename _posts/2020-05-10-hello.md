## Welcome to `itlabbet.se`.

I'd been thinking about setting up a web site for a while when I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) that seemed like a nice static web site creation tool.
Curiousity about Jekyll made me just had to test it out. It turned out that Jekyll is very easy to setup and after a little bit of looking into the details I soon had a small and quite nice looking web site up and running. I found the jekyll theme [chirpy](http://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) 
and liked it immediately.

## Upcoming posts

I have been developing software professionally the last 20 years and admittedly have an interest in`software development` but also `cyber security`. 
Besides this I also enjoy `outdoor activities`, especially `hammocking` and I would be suprised if I won't write a post or two about this matter here. 

If you meet me in person you might also find out that I'm a `senior bragger` about how big fishes I have lured up from the lakes/seas up here in Sweden even though
my times at the water line are more and more rare these days. I still live under the perception that you can't have to many rods or fishing lures.

## Wrapup
Lets see if this renders nicely on my internet facing site but before that lets wrap it up with - `it seems to be working fine on my computer`.
