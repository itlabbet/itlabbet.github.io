## Welcome to `itlabbet.se`.

I've been thinking about setting up a web page for a while when I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) that seems like a nice static web site creation tool.
Curiousity about Jekyll made me have to test it out. It turned out that Jekyll is very easy to setup and after a little bit of looking into the details around setting the 
pieces together I soon had a small and quite nice looking web site up and running. I found the jekyll theme [chirpy](http://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) 
and I liked it immediately.

## Upcoming posts

I have an interest in `software development`, `cyber security` and besides these more professional interests I also enjoy  `outdoor activities`, especially `hammocking` 
and I would be suprised if I won't write a post or two about this matter here. 
If you meet me in person you might also find out that I'm a `senior bragger` about how big fishes I have lured up from the lakes/seas up here in Sweden even though
my times at the water line are more and more rare these days.

Lets see if this renders nicely on my internet facing site but before that lets wrap this up with - `it seems to be working fine on my computer`.
