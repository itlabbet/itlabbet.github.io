## A 3-day trip to `Söderåsen`

Me and a couple of friends got into outdoor activities a couple of years ago and we've been excelling this hobby quite a bit latelly.
It started by building wind protected shelters and sleeping on mattresses. Some of us have been trying tents and a few have been sleeping on spruce.

This time we took a 3 day trip to the pleasent area [Söderåsen](https://visitsoderasen.se/){:target="_blank"}

## Carry your gear
The swedish `allemansrätten` gives you great opportunities to experience the wild life up close and this time of year the Söderåsen area
shows its best sides.

We have decided that all equipment will be carried through the whole trip, meaning you will have to think twice about what you put in your backpack. 
Some of the guys prioritize water, some beer, some sweets or a nice stake but most of us carry something to sleep on and the current popular item,
taken size and wight into consideration, is a hammock. The major benefits of a hammock from my point of view is that its quite light, easy to setup, gives
great cover from bad weather and all you need are two trees a couple of feet apart. Your gear will not be as dirty as when using a tent, since you don't need to
put anything on the ground.
